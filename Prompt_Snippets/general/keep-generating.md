# Keep Generating (ChatGPT Web UI)

When using ChatGPT in the web UI, GPT will sometimes 'cut out' during a long generation.

Frequently (but not always) there's a "continue generating" button to click on.

When that doesn't load, however, the following brusque instructions seem to work fine to get the output to keep going.

```
more
keep going
keep generating
```

If GPT is providing an iterative list and you wish to request X more outputs, you can just add the number. As in:

```
10 more
```
