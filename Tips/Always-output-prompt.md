# Always output the prompt

If you would like ChatGPT to always state the prompt at the end of its output for logging the two datapoints together (ie, prompt and prompt output) you can set this up as a configuration in the "customize GPT" section.

At the time of writing (12-08-24) this works for me:

```
Always include my prompt after the output prefaced "Prompt"
```
