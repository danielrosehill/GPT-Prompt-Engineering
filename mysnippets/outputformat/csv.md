# Output Formatting - CSV

`format the output as CSV`

Can be added onto prompts in order to get GPT to format the output into a comma separated values file for further data work.

`format the output as CSV with the following columns: name containing the entity's name, age containing the entity's name`

This prompt structure can be used to get GPT to construct a data table in CSV format with the instructed parameters.

`format the output as CSV and make it available for download`

This prompt works (sometimes) to generate a download link for the generated CSV. Otherwise GPT will output the CSV in a code fence.
