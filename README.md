# GPT Prompt Engineering 

This is a repository containing strategies I have been experimenting with to improve the outputs from GPTs (but especially ChatGPT) using various attempts to optimise prompts (a field which is now commonly referred to as "prompt engineering").

I will also endeavor to use this repo to gather third-party prompt engineering resources and best practices. 

## Structure

- Prompt engineering resources are listed under `/resources`

Currently this section has the following entities:

- Articles
- Courses & Certifications
- Github repositories
- Guides
- Newsletters
- Organisations
- Websites

- My prompts and prompts snippets are under `/myprompts`


## Disclaimer

Prompt engineering is a young and rapidly-evolving discipline and given the rapidity at which GPTs evolve and change also something of a constantly moving target.
