# GPT Prompt Engineering 

This is a repository containing strategies I have been experimenting with to improve the outputs from GPTs (but especially ChatGPT) using various attempts to optimise prompts (a field which is now commonly referred to as "prompt engineering").

I will also endeavor to use this repo to gather third-party prompt engineering resources and best practices. 

## Structure

### My Prompts And Prompt Snippets

## Disclaimer

Prompt engineering is a young and rapidly-evolving discipline and given the rapidity at which GPTs evolve and change also something of a constantly moving target.
