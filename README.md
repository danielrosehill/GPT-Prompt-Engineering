# GPT Prompt Engineering Resources

This is a repository containing strategies I have been experimenting with to improve the outputs from GPTs (but especially ChatGPT) using various attempts to optimise prompts (a field which is now commonly referred to as "prompt engineering").

I will also endeavor to use this repo to gather third-party prompt engineering resources and best practices. 

## Structure

- `Experiments` - Logs of experiments designed to test the effectiveness of different prompting strategies
- `GPT_Outputs` - Asking GPT to provide its own prompt eng guides 
- `Prompt Snippets` - Snippets I've found helpful in refining prompts
- `Prompts` - Longer prompts
- `Resources` - Mentioned below. Other people's prompt engineering guides.
- ` Templates` - Templates for logging prompt engineering work. Mostly GPT generated to start with my subsequent refinements. 
- `Workarounds` - Strategies for achieving better outputs

 ## Disclaimer

Prompt engineering is a young and rapidly-evolving discipline and given the rapidity at which GPTs evolve and change also something of a constantly moving target.
