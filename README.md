# GPT Prompt Engineering Resources

This is a repository containing strategies I have been experimenting with to improve the outputs from GPTs (but especially ChatGPT) using various attempts to optimise prompts (a field which is now commonly referred to as "prompt engineering").

I will also endeavor to use this repo to gather third-party prompt engineering resources and best practices. 

## Structure

 


### Prompt Engineering Resources (By Category)

Prompt engineering resources are listed under `/Prompt-Eng-Resource-Library`

Currently this section has the following entities:

- Articles
- Courses & Certifications
- Github repositories
- Guides
- Newsletters
- Organisations
- Websites

## Templates For Prompt Engineering

This repository also contains templates for prompt engineering activities like:

- Creating a register of developed GPTs
- Creating a register of GPT prompts (ie, a prompt library)
- Creating a catalog/library of successful GPT prompt executions (prompt output library)

## Prompt Engineering Folder Structure

## Disclaimer

Prompt engineering is a young and rapidly-evolving discipline and given the rapidity at which GPTs evolve and change also something of a constantly moving target.
