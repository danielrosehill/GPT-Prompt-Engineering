This is a repository containing strategies I have been experimenting with to improve the outputs from GPTs (but especially ChatGPT) using various attempts to optimise prompts (a field which is now commonly referred to as "prompt engineering").

I will also endeavor to use this repo to gather third-party prompt engineering resources and best practices. 

## Structure

### GPT Outputs On Prompt Engineering

This repository contains GPT's outputs on how to prompt-engineer.

This raises the question: *can GPT be trusted as an authoritative source on its own prompt engineering?*. I suggest that the answer requires some thought and analysis. 

While ChatGPT seems a little reticent to spill all the prompt engineering beans, it sometimes does produce useful insights. 

Because the model and technology are both fast-evolving, a timestamp is noted.

## Disclaimer

Prompt engineering is a young and rapidly-evolving discipline and given the rapidity at which GPTs evolve and change also something of a constantly moving target.
